| **Function**                      | **Input (Data coming into the pool)**                                          | **Processing within the mining pool**                                                        | **Output (Data leaving the pool)**                                              |

| **1. Transaction Aggregation**     | Transactions from the mempool (pending transactions in the blockchain network) | The mining pool selects transactions from the mempool to create a block based on fees/size.   | Constructed block (a list of transactions ready for mining)                    |
| **2. Work Distribution**           | Block information (block header, nonce, previous block hash, difficulty)       | The pool splits the workload into smaller tasks and assigns them to individual miners.        | Assigned work (tasks) to miners                                                 |
| **3. Receiving Miner Results**     | Hash results from miners (proposed solutions to blocks)                        | The pool validates the received hash values to check if a miner has solved the block.         | Validated results (including possibly a mined block)                            |
| **4. Block Validation**            | Proposed solved block (valid solution from miners)                             | The pool verifies if the block is valid and meets the blockchain conditions (e.g., difficulty).| Solved block (a new block ready to be added to the blockchain)                  |
| **5. Communication with Blockchain**| Confirmed block (a solved block ready for the blockchain network)              | The pool submits the solved block to the network to be added to the blockchain.               | Block added to the blockchain (after validation by other network nodes)         |
| **6. Performance Tracking**        | Miners' hashrates (computing power from each miner)                            | The pool tracks and monitors each miner’s performance (calculations per second) for rewards.  | Performance statistics (miners' shares in block mining, reward data)            |
| **7. Reward Distribution**         | Solved block (mined block with rewards)                                        | Based on performance stats, the pool distributes rewards among miners according to contribution.| Paid rewards (mined coins allocated to individual miners)                       |
| **8. Communication with Miners**   | Miners’ login information (IDs, wallet addresses)                              | The pool records identification data to manage performance and rewards allocation.            | Miner statistics, current work assignment to miners                             |
