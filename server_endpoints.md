## API Endpoint Details

### 1. `/api/auth/login`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Authenticates miners using their credentials. Miners submit their credentials (e.g., API key or username/password) and receive an access token.
- **Input**: Miner credentials (e.g., API key, username/password).
- **Output**: Access token for authenticated session.

### 2. `/api/auth/logout`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Logs out the authenticated miner by invalidating their access token.
- **Input**: Access token.
- **Output**: Confirmation of logout.

### 3. `/api/transactions/aggregate`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Aggregates pending transactions from the mempool and selects them to form a block. This block is prepared for miners to begin mining.
- **Input**: Transactions from mempool.
- **Output**: Assembled block.

### 4. `/api/work/distribute`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Distributes work to miners, including block header, nonce, and difficulty target. The work is divided among miners to calculate the hash for solving the block.
- **Input**: Block header, difficulty target.
- **Output**: Work assigned to miners.

### 5. `/api/work/submit`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Receives results (hash values) from miners. The pool validates these results to determine if the miner has successfully solved the block.
- **Input**: Hash values from miners.
- **Output**: Validated hash results and potential block solution.

### 6. `/api/block/validate`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Validates whether the block solution meets the blockchain's difficulty target and is compliant with the rules of the network.
- **Input**: Proposed block solution.
- **Output**: Validation result (valid or invalid block).

### 7. `/api/block/submit`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Submits a validated block to the blockchain network to be added to the blockchain. If successful, the block is added to the blockchain.
- **Input**: Valid block.
- **Output**: Confirmation that the block has been added to the blockchain.

### 8. `/api/performance/track`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Tracks the hashrate and performance of miners in the pool. This endpoint provides information on each minerâ€™s contribution to the pool.
- **Output**: Miner performance statistics (hashrate, contribution).

### 9. `/api/rewards/distribute`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Distributes rewards to miners based on their contribution (hashrate) to the mining of a validated block.
- **Input**: Valid block, miner performance statistics.
- **Output**: Distributed rewards to miners.

### 10. `/api/miners/register`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Registers new miners to the pool. Miners provide identification details, including wallet addresses and possibly an API key for authorization.
- **Input**: Miner identification details (wallet address, etc.).
- **Output**: Registration confirmation and assignment of mining work.

### 11. `/api/miners/stats`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Provides statistics about individual miners, such as their hashrate, contribution to mining efforts, and their earnings from mining rewards.
- **Output**: Miner performance statistics.
